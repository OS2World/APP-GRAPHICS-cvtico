This program will convert windows 3.0 icons to OS/2 format.  It is my 
first working version and 'just grew', so it isn't very pretty.  It also
isn't very robust.  Error checking is nonexistant.  Although it has the
beginnings of the code needed to convert .ico files that contain multiple
icons, it doesn't do it yet.  This is partly because I haven't found any
windows icon files that contain multiple icons.  It also won't work with 
those dll and exe files that contain gobs of icons.

Having said that, what will it do?  It will convert .ICO files that contain
a single icon.  That accounts for all of the .ICO files that I have seen 
in the MSWIN forum.  The resulting OS/2 icon will have the same resolution
as the original icon.  Generally, this is 32 x 32.  If you bring up the 
icon in ICONEDIT, it will inform you that the icon did not have a 
device independent form and that one has been created for you.  I have 
been deleting the weird windows format then and saving the result.  This
isn't necessary though to use the icon.

With a bit of luck I'll figure out what to do with the XOR mask and fix 
that up in a week or two.

Anyway, I'm tossing this out for whoever wants to use it.  If you give it
to someone else, please give them the source code as well.  The usual 
disclaimers apply:  This program isn't guarenteed to do anything at all.
